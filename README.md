# Settlement-in-Israel

Visualization of settlement in the Land of Israel.</br>
Presentation of settlements in Israel according to the names of the places found in the latest database of the Population Authority.</br>
Creating a visualization using automation tools, automatic identification, analysis of a database of records, conversion</br>
text to video, and geographic information analysis.

Tagging and cleaning xml file using openrefine.
and using the tools of the software.
Enriching the table with additional data with the help of a wikidata search for annual data for settlements, and geographic location of longitude and altitude lines.
To pull the information that was missing I used code in Python and completed data from Wikipedia. I used a library called selenium.

To do the visualization I used the following websites:
https://www.mapcustomizer.com/
https://www.google.com/intl/iw/earth/
Using the first site mapcustomizer I entered the settlements in the order of their establishment based on the information
In the xml file. and I recorded the automation.
After that I edited the video with the marking of the years over time.
The final result:
Two videos from different viewing angles (top view / close-up view).
The first video from a perspective from above on the Land of Israel, shows the progress of the settlement
in Israel by years.
The second video shows the existing settlements in the country in the order they were established and how they look today from a close up view.
